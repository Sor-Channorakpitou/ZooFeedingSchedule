# ZooFeedingSchedule System

📌 Project Overview

The Zoo Feeding Schedule System is a console-based Java application designed to manage zoo animals and their feeding activities and demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming principles.
The system manages zoo animals, their feeding schedules, food types, and caretakers using proper OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces.
All data is persisted in array of the objects.
